# Pure JS Tic Tac Toe

As part of [Javascript TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe), this project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game

## Goals:
- basic 3*3 tic tac toe game with 2 players BUT extensible design
- little to no global code
- 'modules' using function factories in IIFEs
- interface to:
	- allow names
	- (re)start game
	- show results
